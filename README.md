NU CSC 272 Week 1 Discussion 1.

Classes are what we define in a program with the use of methods and variables.
An object however is an instance of the class relying on the methods and variables defined within the class.
With the use of a single class, a programmer can create multiple instances of the data within and modify them accordingly through the methods defined within the class.
Using cash registers as an example, a programmer will define how to add and subtract items to form a total price to give to a customer.
With multiple instances of the same object, each object is able to keep track of their own separate totals utilizing the same methods defined within the class.
